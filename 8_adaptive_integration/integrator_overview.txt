The different integrators are

QARC:	adaptive integration with recursive functions and closed interval evaluation
QARO:	adaptive integration with recursive functions and open interval evaluation, allows infinite limits
QASR:	adaptive integration with non-recursive functions and closed interval evalutation
QASO:	adaptive integration with non-recursive functions and open interval evaluation, allows infinite limits
