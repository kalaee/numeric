Solve Ax = b for x, where b = Ay, using Cholesky decomp
Evaluating the deviation between x and y:
	|x-y| =	5.08526e-15

Compare the algorithm for computation of the absolute value of the determinant with that found using LU decomp in GSL
	det(A)/det(A)_gsl - 1 =	6.66134e-16

Compute the inverse matrix Binv of B. The entrywise norm of B*Binv - I is
	|B*Binv - I| =	5.32444e-16
