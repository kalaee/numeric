Solve Ax = b for x, where b = Ay, using QR decomp
Evaluating the deviation between x and y:
	|x-y| =	6.04042e-12

Compare the algorithm for computation of the absolute value of the determinant
	det(A)/det(A)_gsl - 1 =	-3.26739e-13

Compute the inverse matrix Binv of B. The entrywise norm of B*Binv - I is
	|B*Binv - I| =	5.90601e-11
