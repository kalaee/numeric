To evaluate our implementation of Jacobi diagonalisation
we first consider a symmetric matrix with entries
	A_{ij} = j*sin(i)+cos(j*i) for j >= i
and size COL=ROW=10.
A total of 218 rotations were neccessary for convergence
The eigenvalues are
	-29.2866
	-3.70939
	-2.87808
	-1.35719
	0.362915
	0.778214
	1.90829
	2.05314
	9.05586
	34.231
Since V^-1AV = D, D = diag(eigenvalues), we expect AV == VD
The entrywise norm of |AV - DV| is found to be
	|AV - DV| = 2.08846e-08

We now consider the Hilbert matrix, H_ij = 1/(i+j+1)
From GSL's example on eigensystems the eigenvalues for
the 4th order Hilbert matrix are
	9.6702e-05
	6.7383e-03
	1.6914e-01
	1.5002e+00
Using Jacobi's cyclic algorithm we find them to be
	9.67023e-05
	0.00673827
	0.169141
	1.50021
A total of 24 rotations were necessary.
