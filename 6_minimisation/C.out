Minimising Rosenbrock's valley function
Domain of initial position: -10 < x,y < 10
After 181 steps the function is minimised:
(x,y) = (1	1)
f(x,y) = 3.38258e-20

Minimising Himmelblau's function
Domain of initial position: -10 < x,y < 10
After 84 steps the function is minimised:
(x,y) = (3	2)
f(x,y) = 7.80471e-19

Minimising Three-Hump Camel function
Domain of initial position: -5 < x,y < 5
After 91 steps the function is minimised:
(x,y) = (-1.74755	0.873776)
f(x,y) = 0.298638
Note that although THC has a global minimum at (x,y) = (0,0)
it also has two local minima close the global one, which might be
reached instead.
