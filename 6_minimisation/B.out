Rosenbrock's function:
Initial guess:
x =	-3,	10
True Solution
x =	1,	1
Newton's minimisation method:
	steps=6
	x= 1	1
Quasi-Newton's with SR1:
	steps=19353
	x= 1	1
Newton's root-finding method:
	steps=221
	x= 1	1

Himmelblau's function:
Initial guess:
x =	-3,	10
True Solution
x =	-2.80512,	3.13131
Note that the function has more global minima,
yet, the above solution appears to be the one relevant from our initial guess
Newton's minimisation method:
	steps=8
	x= -2.80512	3.13131
Quasi-Newton's with SR1:
	steps=30
	x= -2.80512	3.13131
Newton's root-finding method:
	steps=8
	x= -2.80512	3.13131

Three-Hump Camel function (THC):
Initial guess:
x =	-0.5,	10
True Solution
x =	0,	0
Note that although THC has one global minimum it also has two other local minima
close to the global minimum. Depending on the initial guess the algorithms might
find these instead and terminate.
Newton's minimisation method:
	steps=6
	x= 1.07054	-0.535271
Quasi-Newton's with SR1:
	steps=14
	x= 2.54862e-12	-1.27431e-12
Newton's root-finding method:
	steps=6
	x= 1.07054	-0.535271
